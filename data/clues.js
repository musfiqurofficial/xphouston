The handwriting is precise, almost clinical, but the phrasing betrays unease: “…Patient, 26 years old, complains of chronic nausea and fits of fatigue for the past four weeks. Symptoms persist—testing suggested if no improvement.” A faint watermark of a caduceus symbol gleams in the corner, hinting at the note’s authenticity.",

The reports detail each murder scene with cold precision, but sections have been blacked out with heavy ink. Careful scrutiny reveals indentations beneath the redactions, as if someone pressed down hard while writing on the other side.",
